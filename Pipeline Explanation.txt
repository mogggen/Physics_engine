Pipeline Explanation

LoadObj returns a handle to be used by:

RasterizeTriangle() to collect the vertices
using the indices from the indexBuffer and
send them as arguments to construct a triangular face

The RasterizeTriangle() function calls the vertexShader(Vertex&) 3 times,
once for each Vertex of the triangle

The VertexShader(Vertex&) calls putpixel() once for each pixel of the current line,
interpolating the values between the two end points of that line.

putpixel(int x, int y) calls, in turn, the fragmentshader() that handles lighting calculations,
returns the pixel color to be written to the color buffer.

putpixel also performs a depth test
when calling getDepthFromPixel()

full pipeline is:
LoadObj -> RasterizeTriangle -> vertexShader -> putpixel -> getDepthFromPixel -> fragmentShader -> texture to be drawn onto quad
