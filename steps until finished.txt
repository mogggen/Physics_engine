transform the triangles into perspective view

load triangles from obj instead of hardcoded

obj verticies position -> into world space -> into projective space -> the quad's texture 

// streach, repeat flipped, repeat texture, solid background color
//nearest, linear

make res.png the texture of the cube (that should be a quad)


port it so it runs as the lab says it should
