render multiple trinangles from .obj to an array and loop through them with isInTriangle()


transform the vertices of the triangles with pvm matrix
and stbi_write_png(res.jpg)

load_from_file()
bind_texture


somehow keep the window input (maybe from the booleans: left, right, up, down, forward, backward)
and apply them to the jpg in realtime
