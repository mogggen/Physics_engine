SAT easy to implement, higher complexity
SAT diffcult to implement, improved complexity

GKJ minkowski sum, relatively easy to implement, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert%E2%80%93Johnson%E2%80%93Keerthi_distance_algorithm
but can only one point so have to store previous points to get the entire collision of e.g a face.
